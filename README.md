## Chosen project

**#7 Individualised / Skilled based 2FA**

The mathematician John Conway setup his computer so that every time he tried to log on (after entering his password) he was presented with a series of random dates for which he had to enter which day of the week each date fell.

If he did not enter the dates quickly enough (within a few seconds) he would be automatically logged out of his computer.

He did this to train his ability to mentally apply the Doomsday rule ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule ) as a party trick.

This, however, is a rather clever example of an individualised, skill based authentication system, e.g. it is an authentication system which arguably he only could do (unless someone trained their ability to do so to the same ability he did).

A team working on this project will investigate the design/usability/security of "individualised authentication systems", e.g solving a chess puzzle in N seconds, solving X anagrams in N seconds, etc.

## Group Project Overview

The group project for Human Centred Security M requires

- proposing ideas for usable security and/or privacy protection mechanisms
- implementing a prototype (can be a paper prototype or a computer prototype)
- evaluating the usability and/or security of the prototype in a user study
- writing a report on the implementation and the evaluation of the results
- preparing a video presentation that demonstrates the prototype, and
summarises the study procedure, the most important results, and the learned lessons.

## Implementation and Evaluation

### Implementation

You can choose to implement a computer prototype (programming route) or a paper prototype (non-programming route).

Programming route groups are expected to implement a functioning prototype (e.g., web or mobile application).

Note that you are asked to implement a prototype, and not a fully working system.

Non-programming route groups are expected to design paper prototypes (or wireframes). As detailed below, groups that choose this route will be expected to do more in the empirical part of the work.

### Evaluation

The aim here is to evaluate the usability and security of the concept you have implemented.

- Define a study design and study procedure. Think of the aspects of your implementation that need to be evaluated. What are the independent and dependent variables? And what are the conditions? What is the baseline condition? The teams should engage with literature and the “Research methods in Usable Security” lecture for inspiration on how to define the study design and study procedure.
- Evaluate all the features that you prototyped in a user study with 6 or more participants.
- Focus on identifying the pros and cons of each experimental condition and collect general feedback about the idea.
- Remember that receiving negative feedback does not result in losing marks as long as you demonstrate that you’ve taken reasonable precautions in the implementation. For example, if you provide a convincing argument why a design decision was taken, but the evaluation results show that it resulted in less usability, then this is not regarded as a shortcoming of your work.
- Define tasks for the participants to make sure they try all the concepts, modes and views you’ve implemented. Like reality, the tasks should tell the participants what they should achieve rather than how to achieve it. The ideal interface is usable and intuitive enough for users to figure out the how on their own.
- Before conducting the study, each member should sign the ethics form on http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ethics/
- The teams are free to use qualitative evaluation measures (e.g., questionnaires, interviews, etc.), quantitative evaluation measures (e.g., usage logs, task completion accuracy, task completion time, etc.), or a combination of both, as long as the methods result in a rigorous evaluation of the implemented concepts.

## Presentation

Prepare a video presentation (use slides) that:

1. demonstrates the prototypes you’ve implemented (e.g., showing the prototype or a video of it), this includes going through all the tasks and showcasing all the features you implemented.
2. summarises the user study procedure.
3. summarises the most important results.
4. summarises the learned lessons and the encountered challenges.

You are free to add more relevant content as long as you cover the above points adequately.

Please keep presentations to a maximum of 5 minutes

## Report

Each team must submit a report (12-point font, single-space, 1-inch margins, 4-6 pages excluding cover page, references and appendices). It should include the following:

- Cover page: detail the team members’ names and student IDs.
- Introduction: motivate the work and introduce the concept that you implemented.
- Concept and Implementation: describe how the system works without a lot of technical details. Provide convincing arguments for your design decisions in terms of security and usability. This section is required for both the programming and non-programming route teams.
- Evaluation: Present the evaluation design and procedure, the tasks, and the results of the evaluation. Add pictures from the user study (only if the participants gave you the consent to do so!) and use charts to explain quantitative results wherever possible.
- Discussion:
    - summarise the results, then
    - discuss what can be learnt from the results and
    - reflect on the encountered challenges (rather than focusing on technical challenges, focus on conceptual usability and security challenges that are relevant to researchers and practitioners).
- Conclusion and Future work: conclude your report and then discuss what future research is promising to pursue in this area. For example, think of other promising concepts, or ways to improve the concept(s) that you’ve implemented.
- References: Use ACM’s reference format: https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting
- Appendices: if you want to add details to the report (e.g., administered questionnaires, mock ups, etc.).

## Deliverables

All teams must submit the following by **4:30pm on 15 March 2024:**

1. A body of work (from milestone 3): programming groups need to submit the source code with an instructions file on how to run it. Non-programming groups need to submit wireframes or scanned paper prototypes along with a description of the possible interactions (e.g., explain what happens if the user presses a certain button).
2. Presentation video + slides (from milestone 4): video in any common format (.mp4, .mov, .avi...), slides in ppt/pptx/pdf. If the video is too big to upload, you can upload it on Onedrive and include a file with the link in your submission. If you opt for this, make sure the link is publicly accessible and note that any updates to the video after the deadline will invalidate this part of your submission.
3. Report (from milestone 5): 4-6 pages in PDF, 12-point font, single-space, 1-inch margins.
4. Workload report single-page PDF detailing the contribution of each member.
5. Ethics form: each student should fill and sign the ethics checklist form on http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ethics/
6. (optional) Personal Assessment of Contribution: you can optionally allocate between 0 and 100 points as a personal assessment to your teammates. This is submitted separately. If an individual does not submit a personal assessment, it will be assumed they acknowledge equal  distribution of workload on team members. The assessment of contribution from each team member will impact the individual grade for the exercise.

Deliverable 1-5 should be compressed into a single .zip file and uploaded onto Moodle using this link: https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=3773948

Deliverable 6 can be optionally sent to the instructor via email to [Joseph.OHagan@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Joseph.OHagan@glasgow.ac.uk)

Not submitting any of the non-optional deliverables by the deadline will result in an overall grade of 0. Give yourself enough time to ensure everything is uploaded in time.
